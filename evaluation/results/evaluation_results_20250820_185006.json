Use **Kita® 75 WP** (Mancozeb 75% wp) at 2.0 - 2.5 g/L of water as a protective fungicide, applied every 7 days for 2-3 applications. This contact fungicide is useful for managing blast and reducing the risk of resistance development when used in rotation with systemic fungicides. Consider **Biostimulant Application**: Apply **Seakem® Liquid Seaweed Extract (NPK 0-0-3)** at 5-10 mL/L of water every 14 days to enhance plant health and resistance to disease stress.

Soil drench with **Actinomax (Bacillus subtilis)** at 2ml/L of water once, to promote beneficial microbial activity and support plant health. This bio-stimulant is suitable for rice crops in tropical climates like Malaysia's. Prune affected leaves and dispose of them properly to reduce disease spread. Apply a **wound healer (e.g., Agristim)** to the pruned areas to prevent secondary infections.
